# 🧬 Darwin World - Evolution Simulator

An interactive evolution simulator that demonstrates natural selection, genetics, and survival of the fittest in real-time. Watch as digital creatures evolve, fight, reproduce, and adapt to their environment!

## 🌟 Features

### Genetic System
- **3 Core Traits**: Size (strength), Speed (movement), and Aggression (fighting tendency)
- **Inheritance**: Offspring inherit traits from both parents through genetic crossover
- **Mutations**: Random mutations introduce genetic variation during reproduction
- **Generational Tracking**: Monitor evolution across generations

### Creature Behaviors
- **Survival Mechanics**: Energy management, aging, and natural death
- **Food Seeking**: Hungry creatures actively search for sustenance
- **Combat System**: Aggressive creatures fight, with size determining strength
- **Reproduction**: Well-fed creatures mate and produce genetically diverse offspring

### Evolution in Action
- **Natural Selection**: Successful traits become more common over time
- **Population Dynamics**: Self-regulating population based on resources and survival
- **Trait Evolution**: Watch average population traits change over generations
- **Emergent Behaviors**: Complex behaviors emerge from simple rules

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/carlospuenteg/Darwin-World.git
   cd Darwin-World
   ```

2. **Open in browser**:
   - Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser
   - No installation or build process required!

3. **Controls**:
   - **Start/Pause**: Control the simulation
   - **Reset**: Start over with a new random population
   - **Speed Control**: Adjust simulation speed (1x to 5x)

## 🎨 Visual Guide

- **🔴 Red Creatures**: High aggression (fighters)
- **🟠 Orange Creatures**: Medium aggression (balanced)
- **🟢 Green Creatures**: Low aggression (peaceful)
- **🔵 Blue Dots**: Food sources
- **Energy Bars**: Show creature health/energy levels
- **Age Indicators**: Small dots showing creature age

## 🔬 The Science Behind It

This simulator demonstrates key evolutionary concepts:

- **Fitness Landscapes**: Different trait combinations have different survival rates
- **Genetic Drift**: Random mutations create population diversity
- **Selection Pressure**: Limited resources and combat create survival challenges
- **Inheritance Patterns**: Successful traits are passed to offspring
- **Population Bottlenecks**: Low population events can dramatically affect gene pools

## 📊 What to Observe

Over time, you might notice:
- Population becoming more aggressive in competitive environments
- Size increases when strength provides survival advantage
- Speed evolution when escape becomes important
- Cyclical population dynamics
- Trait specialization in different conditions

## 🛠 Technical Details

- **Language**: Pure JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Graphics**: HTML5 Canvas
- **Architecture**: Object-oriented design with Creature and World classes
- **Performance**: Optimized for real-time simulation of 50+ creatures
- **Compatibility**: Works in all modern browsers

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Environmental challenges (temperature, disasters)
- More complex genetics (recessive/dominant traits)
- Predator-prey relationships
- Territory and group behaviors
- Data export for analysis
- 3D visualization
